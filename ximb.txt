S President Donald Trump has turned down India's invitation to be the chief guest during the Republic Day Parade. This comes at a time when relations between the countries are not in the best of health.

The US had recently issued warning against India if it goes ahead with signing the S-400 missile system deal with Russia. India signed the deal for five such systems when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited India earlier this month.
